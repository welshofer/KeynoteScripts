# KeynoteScripts
Simple AppleScripts for automating various tasks associated with making and maintaining Keynote presentations.

All these scripts either have code written by Sal Soghoian, or have code that I managed to cobble together only with his help. I would have produced nothing of use without his help and patience. Everyone who benefits from these scripts owes him thanks.

adjust_presenter_notes - allows you to set a font and size and then applies this setting to the presenter notes on each slide in the front most deck. Will destroy any other formatting - my apologies - an artifact of what is supported in Keynote's AppleScript model.
                         
erase_presenter_notes - erases every speaker note in the entire deck. Useful when sending a presentation to someone else and you would prefer that they not see your notes.
                        
presenter_notes_to_pages - Exports the speaker notes of decks dropped onto it as individual Pages files (one for each Keynote file). Useful for folks who just want to review their notes, for handing off to translators, closed captionists, ASL translators, etc. Good example (thanks to Sal!) of how to deal with single file vs. package files and processing of multiple dropped files.

grids - creates a grid of lines on the current slide of the frontmost Keynote deck
golden_ratio_grid - creates a Golden Ratio grid on the current slide of the frontmost Keynote deck
                          
More to come.

On the agenda: 

slidewise presentation duplicator - when you want to change slide size but want to keep everything where it is now and at the same size. Includes copying of speaker notes.

Nothing followsâ€¦
