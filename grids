-- creates a grid of lines on the current slide of the frontmost Keynote deck

-- these values well for a deck that is 2048x1536
-- for a square grid, choose gridSize value that divides evenly for both width and height

property gridSize : 128

tell application "Keynote"
	activate
	tell document 1
		set documentWidth to its width
		set documentHeight to its height
		tell current slide
			repeat with y from gridSize to (documentHeight - gridSize) by gridSize
				set thisLine to make new line with properties {start point:{gridSize, y}, end point:{documentWidth - gridSize, y}, reflection showing:false}
			end repeat
			repeat with x from gridSize to (documentWidth - gridSize) by gridSize
				set thisLine to make new line with properties {start point:{x, gridSize}, end point:{x, documentHeight - gridSize}, reflection showing:false}
			end repeat
		end tell
	end tell
end tell
